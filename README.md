- 👋 Hi, I’m @XinboUM, Xinbo Li from the University of Manitoba.
- 👀 I’m interested in high-performance computational electromagnetics solvers in layered structure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning layered medium 3D MoM mixed potential integral equation (MPIE) solver Green's function generator.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on H matrix and FMM accelerated layered medium MPIE solver.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email can be found in the paper I published.
